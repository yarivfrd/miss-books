        "description": "“It’s uncommon to have a programming language wonk who can speak in such comfortable and friendly language as David does. His walk through the syntax and semantics of JavaScript is both charming and hugely insightful; reminders of gotchas complement realistic use cases, paced at a comfortable curve. You’ll find when you finish the book that you’ve gained a strong and comprehensive sense of mastery.” —Paul Irish, developer advocate, Google Chrome “This is not a book for those looking for shortcuts; rather it is hard-won experience distilled into a guided tour. It’s one of the few books on JS that I’ll recommend without hesitation.” —Alex Russell, TC39 member, software engineer, Google In order to truly master JavaScript, you need to learn how to work effectively with the language’s flexible, expressive features and how to avoid its pitfalls. No matter how long you’ve been writing JavaScript code, Effective JavaScript will help deepen your understanding of this powerful language, so you can build more predictable, reliable, and maintainable programs. Author David Herman, with his years of experience on Ecma’s JavaScript standardization committee, illuminates the language’s inner workings as never before—helping you take full advantage of JavaScript’s expressiveness. Reflecting the latest versions of the JavaScript standard, the book offers well-proven techniques and best practices you’ll rely on for years to come. Effective JavaScript is organized around 68 proven approaches for writing better JavaScript, backed by concrete examples. You’ll learn how to choose the right programming style for each project, manage unanticipated problems, and work more successfully with every facet of JavaScript programming from data structures to concurrency. Key features include Better ways to use prototype-based object-oriented programming Subtleties and solutions for working with arrays and dictionary objects Precise and practical explanations of JavaScript’s functions and variable scoping semantics Useful JavaScript programming patterns and idioms, such as options objects and method chaining In-depth guidance on using JavaScript’s unique “run-to-completion” approach to concurrency",

But TypeScript has a learning curve of its own, and understanding how to use it effectively can take time. This book guides you through 62 specific ways to improve your use of TypeScript. Author Dan Vanderkam, a principal software engineer at Sidewalk Labs, shows you how to apply these ideas, following the format popularized by Effective C++ and Effective Java (both from Addison-Wesley). You’ll advance from a beginning or intermediate user familiar with the basics to an advanced user who knows how to use the language well. Effective TypeScript is divided into eight chapters: Getting to Know TypeScript TypeScript’s Type System Type Inference Type Design Working with any Types Declarations and @types Writing and Running Your Code Migrating to TypeScript",

This book provides readers with a thorough understanding of both basic and complex algorithms, using the flexibility and comprehensiveness of JavaScript to illustrate real-world applications. Whether you are an aspiring developer or a seasoned programmer looking to refine your skills, this guide provides the essential knowledge and practical experience needed to harness JavaScript for algorithm development. Structured to facilitate a step-by-step learning process, the book begins by establishing the core programming concepts and environments necessary for efficient JavaScript coding. Each subsequent chapter builds on this foundation, delving into topics such as variable manipulation, control flow mechanisms, data structures, and recursion. Detailed examples and exercises ensure that readers not only grasp theoretical concepts but also gain practical skills in implementing these concepts with precision. By integrating traditional algorithmic principles with modern JavaScript practices, the book bridges the gap between theoretical and practical coding techniques. Readers will emerge from this book with the capability to design and implement algorithms tailored to specific requirements, using JavaScript's robust features. The guide provides the tools needed to analyze, optimize, and elevate their programming capabilities, turning algorithmic challenges into manageable tasks. This comprehensive resource equips readers to tackle a wide array of computational problems, fostering a deeper understanding of both fundamental and advanced programming concepts and empowering them to develop efficient, scalable JavaScript applications.",

His walk through the syntax and semantics of JavaScript is both charming and hugely insightful; reminders of gotchas complement realistic use cases, paced at a comfortable curve. You'll find when you finish the book that you've gained a strong and comprehensive sense of mastery.\"-Paul Irish, developer advocate, Google Chrome \"This is not a book for those looking for shortcuts; rather it is hard-won experience distilled into a guided tour. It's one of the few books on JS that I'll recommend without hesitation.\"-Alex Russell, TC39 member, software engineer, Google In order to truly master JavaScript, you need to learn how to work effectively with the language's flexible, expressive features and how to avoid its pitfalls. No matter how long you've been writing JavaScript code, Effective JavaScript will help deepen your understanding of this powerful language, so you can build more predictable, reliable, and maintainable programs. Author David Herman, with his years of experience on Ecma's JavaScript standardization committee, illuminates the language's inner workings as never before-helping you take full advantage of JavaScript's expressiveness. Reflecting the latest versions of the JavaScript standard, the book offers well-proven techniques and best practices you'll rely on for years to come. Effective JavaScript is organized around 68 proven approaches for writing better JavaScript, backed by concrete examples. You'll learn how to choose the right programming style for each project, manage unanticipated problems, and work more successfully with every facet of JavaScript programming from data structures to concurrency. Key features include Better ways to use prototype-based object-oriented programming Subtleties and solutions for working with arrays and dictionary objects Precise and practical explanations of JavaScript's functions and variable scoping semantics Useful JavaScript programming patterns and idioms, such as options objects and method chaining In-depth guidance on using JavaScript's unique \"run-to-completion\" approach to concurrency",
